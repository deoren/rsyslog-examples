# rsyslog-examples

Example rsyslog configuration files and related content. Most often used for reporting issues to main rsyslog project, but may also be used to support others that report issues.

## repo layout

### `scripts`

These are small scripts that I use myself and may refer to when offering feedback to others on the mailing list or on a GitHub issue.

### `scratch-notes`

Small, incomplete or questionable details that do not fit well elsewhere.

### `github_issues`

Configurations and related files used to illustrate or help reproduce specific problems reported on a GitHub issue. I may also reference this content from mailing list postings when seeking input from others.

### `etc`

Production (or near) ready configurations that I use myself for systems in active use. Admittedly the directory was poorly placed, but for now it will remain as it is.
