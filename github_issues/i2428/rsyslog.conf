# Goal: 
#
#    minimal configuration used to reproduce original report on rsyslog/rsyslog#2428
#
# Dependencies: 
#
#    /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/00rsyslog.conf (default for Ubuntu 16.04 and newer)
#    /etc/tmpfiles.d/00rsyslog.conf (user-provided copy of the same conf settings)
#
#  Either of these will provide rsyslog access to /var/log as a non-root user
#
# Notes:
#
#    This conf is based on the original Ubuntu 16.04 provided conf file.
#    Modifications include removing unneeded settings/directives and
#    the addition of a test rule provided by the original report.
